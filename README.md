# Progress Bar
## Description
This is a single-line implementation of a progress bar for C/C++. As more applications arise, I will create more version in the future.
Feel free to send me any suggestions!

## Existing Future Work
The current version exists as a standalone piece of code, but I am planning to develop this into a header file.

## Versions
Progress_Bar: The size of the progress bar is determined by a variable within the code.
Progress_Bar_CL: The size of the progress bar is determined by a command-line argument.
