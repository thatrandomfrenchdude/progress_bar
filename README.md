# Progress Bar
## Description
This is a single-line implementation of a progress bar for C/C++. As more applications arise, I will create more version in the future.
Feel free to send me any suggestions!<br /><br />
The current implementation uses a wait to simulate other code running and limit the execution speed of the progress bar. In actual use, the wait can be removed as additional lines of code will limit the execution speed of the progress bar.

## Existing Future Work
The current version exists as a standalone piece of code, but I am planning to develop this into a header file.

## Versions
**Progress_Bar:** The size of the progress bar is determined by a variable within the code.<br />
**Progress_Bar_CL:** The size of the progress bar is determined by a command-line argument.
